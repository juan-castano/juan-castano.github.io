Hi, there!

[Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/repo/git-scm-lecture), you will find a brief slide about git-scm (in Spanish). 

Inside this, you'll discover some tools and cheat sheet with some useful commands which it will become useful in your journey. I hope you enjoy it!

[This link](https://github.com/juan-castano/workshops/blob/master/workshop-git.md) contains a short workshop (in Spanish too) for applying and learn new commands.

Cheers and good commits.
